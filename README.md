Recommendations

2.  Investigate why Finance and Media have lower employee counts. Are these departments underperforming, or facing attrition?
3. Introduce employee benefits for married employees, and also flexible working hours to allow easy work flow. 
4. Retention Strategy per Role: With Technology having the most employees, consider analyzing attrition rates specifically in this role to develop targeted retention strategies.
5. Introduce or strengthen Diversity, Equity & Inclusion programs to ensure fair representation in promotions, especially in male-dominated roles.

Conclusion

Promotions appear slightly upwards in favor of males, indicating potential gaps in advancement opportunities. Most employees are concentrated in Technology, Healthcare, and Education roles. Marital status also shows a significant presence of married employees followed by singles and divorced individuals.
